# Rock Scissors Paper

Rock, Scissors, Paper is a simple and popular game played by two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are rock (a closed fist), paper (an open hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers together forming a V). The game has three possible outcomes other than a tie: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
