# Contributing to Our Project

I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug / issue/ feature request
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Contribution Flow

Follow these steps to contribute to this project:

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of this repository. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**
   - Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the 'Code' button and then click the 'copy to clipboard' icon to get the URL. Then, open a terminal and run the following git command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/islamumarov/rock-scissors-paper.git
    ```

3. **Create a Branch**
   - Navigate to the directory where the project resides and checkout to a new branch using the following command:
  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```

4. **Make Necessary Changes and Commit Those Changes**
   - Make the changes you want to see in the project. Then, add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   - Now, commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "your-commit-message"
   ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**
    - Push your changes using the command `git push`:

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

6. **Submit Your Changes for Review**
    - If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button. Now, submit the pull request.
7. **Pull Request Reviews**
    - Once you have submitted the pull request, it will be reviewed by the maintainers of this repository. If they suggest any changes, make the changes in your branch, commit them and the pull request will be updated automatically.
8. **Pull Request Approval**

- If your pull request is approved, the changes will be merged into the main codebase. If it is not approved, you will receive feedback on what to improve.

Congratulations! You have just contributed to this project.

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

So all code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Here's [an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. Not kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs

- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
